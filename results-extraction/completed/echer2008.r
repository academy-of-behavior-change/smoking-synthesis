### INSTRUCTIONS:
### Work through the sections below, and complete the information. There
### are three types of information:
###   - Text:   this can be any content; has to be in between double quotes.
###   - Number: Any number; cannot contain any other  characters, should not be quoted.
###   - NA:     For missing information, just use NA, always without quotes (just
###             the two characters NA).
###   â€“ Vector: Lists of either numbers of text elements; see the instructions!

Categorized report of interviews with quitters who'd quit beyond the six-month point.
Responses to the question ''What factors contribute to a successful smoking cessation?'

### SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sample, in text (e.g. "Single mothers" or "West-Coast participants", etc)
res$sample$description <- "Quitters over 6 months";

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "Porto Allegro, Brazil";

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 16;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.


##########################################################################
### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "qualitative"; ##stemi-structured interview

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);

### For each measurement moment, specify the sample size.
### If there's only one measurement moment, leave it like this
### and the general sample size will automatically be inserted.
### If sample sizes differ, add subsequent sample sizes like this:
###
###   res$measurementSampleSizes <- c(res$sample$size, 400, 300);
###
### (for an example where the sample size for the second wave is
###  400, and for the third wave, 300 (and for the first wave,
###  taken from the general sample size))
res$measurementSampleSizes <- res$sample$size;

### Some verification functions; note that these need the 'userfriendlyscience'
### package to be installed and loaded (with 'require').

### This function checks whether for all variables that are used, the
### operationalisation is also extracted, and vice versa:
extractionVerification(res);


### For showing the entire dataframes
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedVariables)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedUnivariate)
