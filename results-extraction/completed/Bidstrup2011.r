###   - Text:   this can be any content; has to be in between double quotes.
###   - Number: Any number; cannot contain any other  characters, should not be quoted.
###   - NA:     For missing information, just use NA, always without quotes (just
###             the two characters NA).
###   â€“ Vector: Lists of either numbers of text elements; see the instructions!

###  GENERAL INFORMATION / COMMENTS ON THIS STUDY:
###
res$generalComments <- "

There's two measurement moments, however the results discussed in the paper were only
obtained in the second interview. 
The current study is connected to a quantitative intervention study. 
The 12 students reported in the current qualitative results are also 
part of the sample of the connected quantitative study. 
The sample is very multi-ethnic.

### SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sample, in text (e.g. "Single mothers" or "West-Coast participants", etc)
res$sample$description <- "grade 7 and 8 adolescents";

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "Danish";

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 12;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.


##########################################################################
### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "qualitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);
