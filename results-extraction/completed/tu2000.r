### SAMPLE DESCRIPTION

### Description of sample, in text (e.g. "Single mothers" or "West-Coast participants", etc)
res$sample$description <- "Chinese american men >17"; #current or past smokers

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "Seattle, washington, USA";

###Description of one or multiple unusual circumstances involving sample, 
###e.g. "patients" or "intervention", any major criterium that
###doesn't adhere to the idea of 'population as usual'. In text or ''.
res$sample$selectedSample <- c('');

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 34;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "quantitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);

### Some verification functions; note that these need the 'userfriendlyscience'
### package to be installed and loaded (with 'require').

### This function checks whether for all variables that are used, the
### operationalisation is also extracted, and vice versa:
#extractionVerification(res);

### For showing the entire dataframes
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedVariables)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedUnivariate)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedAssociations)
