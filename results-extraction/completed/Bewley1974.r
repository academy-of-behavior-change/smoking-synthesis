### INSTRUCTIONS:
### Work through the sections below, and complete the information. There
### are three types of information:
###   - Text:   this can be any content; has to be in between double quotes.
###   - Number: Any number; cannot contain any other  characters, should not be quoted.
###   - NA:     For missing information, just use NA, always without quotes (just
###             the two characters NA).
###   â€“ Vector: Lists of either numbers of text elements; see the instructions!

###  GENERAL INFORMATION / COMMENTS ON THIS STUDY:
###
res$generalComments <- "

The original N was 293, but due to the small number of girls (64), 
only data on boys are reported in current paper.
This brings the N down to 229. (See: Summary page 37/38)

### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "quantitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);

### Some verification functions; note that these need the 'userfriendlyscience'
### package to be installed and loaded (with 'require').

### This function checks whether for all variables that are used, the
### operationalisation is also extracted, and vice versa:
extractionVerification(res);

### For showing the entire dataframes
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedVariables)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedUnivariate)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedAssociations)
