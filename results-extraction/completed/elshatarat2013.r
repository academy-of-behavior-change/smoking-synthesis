### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "qualitative"; ### "Face to face interviews using a structured questionnaire";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);

### modifiable determinant or belief related to smoking, and smoking
### initiation or cessation.

### Some verification functions; note that these need the 'metabefor'
### package to be installed and loaded (with 'require').

### This function checks whether for all variables that are used, the
### operationalisation is also extracted, and vice versa:
extractionVerification(res);

### For showing the entire dataframes
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedVariables)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedUnivariate)
