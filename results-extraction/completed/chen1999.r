### SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sample, in text
res$sample$description = "Random samples of adolescents in California in 1988"

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "California, USA"

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 347 + 10129

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "quantitative"

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0)
