### INSTRUCTIONS:
### Work through the sections below, and complete the information. There
### are three types of information:
###   - Text:   this can be any content; has to be in between double quotes.
###   - Number: Any number; cannot contain any other  characters, should not be quoted.
###   - NA:     For missing information, just use NA, always without quotes (just
###             the two characters NA).
###   â€“ Vector: Lists of either numbers of text elements; see the instructions!

###  GENERAL INFORMATION / COMMENTS ON THIS STUDY:
###
res$generalComments <- "

smokers or ex-smokers who had made at least one attempt to stop in the pre-
vious five years, formed the second stage population, which was
sent a further questionnaire in November 1990.
The second questionnaire investigated demographic factors,
social factors, health beliefs and attitudes, reasons for trying to
stop smoking, cessation methods used, and factors associated
with relapse.

The successful quitters in table 1 p. 246.

Due to the data being presented as crosstabs, succesful and unsuccesful 
quitters are not entered as subsamples but as variables.

### SAMPLE DESCRIPTION
##########################################################################

### Description of sample, in text (e.g. "Single mothers" or "West-Coast participants", etc)
res$sample$description <- "Adults";

### Description of geography of sample, in text
res$sample$geography <- "Aberdeen, Scotland";

### Sample size, as a number
res$sample$size <- 86+425;

### SUBSAMPLES - REMOVE THIS SECTION IF THERE ARE NO SUBSAMPLES

### Indicate which information you want to override. Specify the subsample
### you're providing new data for in the single quotes between the double
### brackets; make sure the spelling is exactly identical to the list above.
### Use NA to specify data that should not be overridden.

##See succesful quitters and unsuccesful quitters in Measurements and manipulations for further explanation as to why
##the subsamples below were commented rather than removed. They don't make sense as variables, but then the matrix would
##have to be interpreted differently, which seems unpractical. Either way it's now easier to change from one to the other 
##if required. 


##########################################################################
### METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
##########################################################################

### Specify how the data was collected ("qualitative" or "quantitative")
res$datacollectionmethod <- "quantitative";

### Specify how many measurement moments the study has, as a number (of
### course, this will just be 1 for most studies)
res$measurementMoments <- 1;

### For each measurement moment, specify the number of days since the
### first measurement moment. This is a vector of days; e.g., for three
### measurement moments, each a month apart, this would be:
### res$measurementTimes <- c(0, 30, 60);
res$measurementTimes <- c(0);

### Some verification functions; note that these need the 'userfriendlyscience'
### package to be installed and loaded (with 'require').

### This function checks whether for all variables that are used, the
### operationalisation is also extracted, and vice versa:
#extractionVerification(res);

### For showing the entire dataframes
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedVariables)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedUnivariate)
#print.data.frame(extractionVerification(res)$dat$extractedAssociations)
